This script uses the ArcGIS API for Python to find the shortest route between two points on a map, and outputs the route as a GeoJSON file. You can use this script to find the shortest route between two addresses, or the shortest route between two latitude/longitude coordinates.

First, you'll need to install the ArcGIS API for Python and the `geojson` library by running `pip install arcgis geojson` in your command prompt or terminal.

Next, you'll need to create a free ArcGIS account and obtain a API key by following the instructions here: [https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/install-and-set-up/](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/install-and-set-up/)

Once you have your API key, you can use the following script to find the shortest route between two points.

To use this script, simply replace `POINT_1` and `POINT_2` with the coordinates or addresses of the two points you want to find the shortest route between, and run the script using Python. The script will output a GeoJSON file containing the shortest route between the two points.

I hope this script is helpful for automating your GIS-related tasks! Let me know if you have any questions.
