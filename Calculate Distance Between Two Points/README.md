This script uses the ArcGIS API for Python to calculate the distance between two points on a map. You can use this script to calculate the distance between two addresses, or the distance between two latitude/longitude coordinates.

First, you'll need to install the ArcGIS API for Python by running `pip install arcgis` in your command prompt or terminal.

Next, you'll need to create a free ArcGIS account and obtain a API key by following the instructions here: [https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/install-and-set-up/](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/install-and-set-up/)

Once you have your API key, you can use the following script to calculate the distance between two points.

To use this script, simply replace `POINT_1` and `POINT_2` with the coordinates or addresses of the two points you want to measure, and run the script using Python. The script will output the distance between the two points in miles.

I hope this script is helpful for automating your GIS-related tasks! Let me know if you have any questions.
