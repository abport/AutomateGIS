# This script creates a buffer around a bunch of shapes in a geodatabase.

# First, we need to import some libraries that have special tools for working with files and GIS data.
import os
import arcpy

# Next, we need to tell the script where to find the input data and where to save the output data.
in_dir = r"C:\input_data"  # This is the folder where the input geodatabase is stored.
out_dir = r"C:\output_data"  # This is the folder where we want to save the output geodatabase.

# We also need to tell the script the names of the input and output geodatabases.
in_name = "input.gdb"  # This is the name of the input geodatabase.
out_name = "output.gdb"  # This is the name of the output geodatabase.

# Now we can use a tool from the arcpy library to set the workspace to the input directory.
arcpy.env.workspace = in_dir  # This sets the current folder to the input data folder.

# Now we can use another tool from the arcpy library to get a list of all the feature classes in the input geodatabase.
fcs = arcpy.ListFeatureClasses()  # This gets a list of all the feature classes

# Now we can loop through the list of feature classes.
for fc in fcs:
    # For each feature class, we need to get the full path of the input and output feature classes.
    in_fc = os.path.join(in_dir, in_name, fc)  # This is the full path of the input feature class.
    out_fc = os.path.join(out_dir, out_name, fc)  # This is the full path of the output feature class.
    
    # Now we can use a tool from the arcpy library to create a buffer around the input feature class.
    arcpy.Buffer_analysis(in_fc, out_fc, "1000 Meters")  # This creates a buffer with a distance of 1000 meters around the input feature class and saves it as the output feature class.
